        <p>
           You will find here the information that you need for completing the step.<br>

    <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-1">
        <h3 class="lead text-primary"> Html source </h3>
        <p>
            Here you will visualize the source of the html form that you will need to create xpaths for.
            <br>The object(s) that you will need to select with the xpath will be highlighted in grey so you will know what to focus upon.
        </p>
        <p>

        <br>When you will write a valid xpath, all the objects that your xpath refers to will be highlighted in blue.
        <br>When the object(s) selected with your xpath match the given object(s) to be selected, it(they) will be highlighted in green color and you'll receive a message.
        This is the moment you know you're done with the step.

        </p>
        <p>

        <br>You will write your xpath in the below input.
        <br>If you type an xpath that is invalid, it will change its color to red.
        <br>If you type an xpath that is valid but does not match any node, nothing happens.

        <div class="form-group" id="xpath-form">
            <label>Type the xpath here:</label>
            <input type="text" class="form-control long-input " ng-model="xpath" ng-class="validateXpath()"
                   placeholder="Enter the xpath"/>
        </div>

        </p>

        <div class="match" ng-show="match">Good job!</div>

            This is where you'll visualize the html section that you'll need to work on.
            The object(s) that you need to select will be highlighted in grey so you will know what to focus upon.
            <br><br>When the introduced xpath will match the expected object(s), it(they) will be highlighted in green color.
